# StaticWebMastery

This repository serves as my personal playground for experimenting with HTML and CSS to enhance my web development skills. It's a space where I can create and refine static web pages, explore new design ideas, and continuously improve my coding abilities.

Inside this repository, you'll find a collection of web pages that I've created as part of my journey to becoming a better front-end developer. These pages may not be perfect, but they represent my commitment to learning and growing in the world of web development.

Feel free to take a look at my projects and code. While this repository is primarily for my personal practice, I'm open to feedback and suggestions from the community. Together, we can learn and grow in the exciting world of web development.

Happy coding!
